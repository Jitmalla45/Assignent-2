/*Output Explanation:
The function f1 is called with the 2D array m and dim1 equal to 3. The function increments each element of the 2D array by 2. Here's a breakdown of what happens:

The outer loop (i) iterates over each row.
The inner loop (j) iterates over each element (column) within a row.
Each element of the array is updated by adding 2 to its original value.
For example, the element at m[0][0] is incremented from 1 to 3, m[0][1] from 2 to 4, and so on for every element in the array.

Initial 2D Array:
1  2  3  4  5
11 12 13 14 15
21 22 23 34 25
Modified 2D Array (after adding 2 to each element):
3  4  5  6  7
13 14 15 16 17
23 24 25 36 27
Validity of Passing a 2D Array Without Specifying the First Dimension:
Yes, it is valid to pass a 2D array to a function without specifying the first dimension. This is because:

The first dimension (number of rows) is not necessary for the compiler to calculate the memory addresses of the elements.
The second dimension (number of columns) is crucial for the compiler to compute the correct memory location of each element when performing pointer arithmetic.
As long as the second dimension is specified, the compiler can correctly access the elements in the 2D array using the row and column indices.*/
